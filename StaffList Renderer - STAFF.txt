For this package anyone who is either WIZARD\, ROYALTY\, or on the +staff list is able to use admin commands\, but Penn's built-in commands use other standards.%R%RPennMUSH has 3 Staff tiers.%R%R1. The [ansi(hr,GOD)] (#1) is a special WIZARD capable of granting or removing the WIZARD flag to other characters. It can use @config/save and several other dangerous commands. Only login as #1 when truly necessary. Since even WIZARDS cannot control() it\, code objects cannot set attributes on #1 and it cannot use many softcoded systems properly.%R%R2. [ansi(hy,WIZARD)] flagged characters have command of everything in the game including dangerous commands such as @force (on players)\, @shutdown\, @hook\, and @config/set. It should be reserved for staff who absolutely need these privileges\, typically the coder(s) and owner. Some potentially dangerous softcoded commands are restricted to Wizard.%R%R3. [ansi(hc,ROYALTY)] have 'see but not touch' compared to WIZARDS - they have several implicit @powers like being able to @tel anywhere but can't change the game's code. This is a good flag for general staff.
